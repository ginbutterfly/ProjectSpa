This heat stimulates collagen production, improves blood circulation, oxygenation and healthy cell turnover. The overall result is tighter, brighter, healthier skin with a significant reduction in wrinkles, acne and hyperpigmentation.</a>
					<a>The radio frequency facial therapy has been approved by the FDA as a non-surgical treatment for problematic skin imperfections. This treatment requires no downtime. Best of all, results are immediately noticeable.</a>
